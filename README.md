In this course an entire data science workflow was carried out end-to-end using multiple notebook-labs from data collection over exploratory analysis, predictive modelling to presentation of the results. Aim of this project was to gain insights on the differential characteristics separating a successful from an unsuccessful launch of reusable SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets.
